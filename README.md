# anagram coding test

Implement `Solver.IsAnagram` so that it returns `true` if the two phrases passed are anagrams of one another, and `false` otherwise.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)
> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram, or the word binary into brainy.
